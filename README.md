# Crud
My first commit
To create the crud use three tools:
1- XAMPP (to create the database with its table)
2- Visual Studio Code (to create the different .py, .html, .css files and modify the page to my liking.)
3- Git (to upload the project to my github.)
My crud is a basic page, in which a contest is presented in which you can point and verify how you have entered the contest.
